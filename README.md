An example chatbot using [Gradio](https://gradio.app), [`huggingface_hub`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.22.2/en/index), and the [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index).

you can customize this chatbot to have whatever personality you want by just changing the base prompt, and changing the avatar to your own image. This is for hosting on hugging face but you can host wherever with adjustments to the code. Eventually will have Text to speech abilities as well as other cool functions such as live 2D avatar.

This bot can be fully uncenssored with custom configurations.
